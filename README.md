## The mod itself

This mod adds to Minecraft 8 new snowballs (including the classic one) which are all craftable in vanilla. Every new snowball can be crafted by surrounding a key item with 8 vanilla snowballs. Quantity of resulting snowball may change.

* The ![snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/snowball.png)*vanilla snowball* now only affects players. It doesn't hurt but the damage knockback still happens.
* The ![fire_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/fire_snowball.png) *fire snowball* is crafted with one blaze powder. It will set on fire players for 3 seconds. The recipe gives you 32 items.
* The ![flint_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/flint_snowball.png) *flint snowball* is crafted with one flint. It will deal 1-heart damage to players. The recipe gives you 32 items.
* The ![gum_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/gum_snowball.png) *gum snowball* is crafted with one slimeball. It will apply **Slowness I** to players for 5 seconds. The recipe gives you 32 items.
* The ![poison_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/poison_snowball.png) *poison snowball* is crafted with one spider eye. It will apply **p$Poison I** to players for 3 seconds. The recipe gives you 32 items.
* The ![tnt_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/tnt_snowball.png) *TNT snowball* is crafted with one TNT. It will make an explosion (not as strong as a real TNT one) if the snowball meets something. The recipe gives you 32 items.
* The ![wither_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/wither_snowball.png) *wither snowball* is crafted with one wither skeleton skull. It will apply **Wither I** to players for 3 seconds. The recipe gives you 32 items.
* The ![zombie_snowball](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocorean/moresnowballs/v1.12/src/main/resources/assets/moresnowballs/textures/items/zombie_snowball.png) *zombie snowball* is crafted with one zombie skull. It will spawn an highlit zombie if the snowball meets something. The recipe gives you 32 items.
